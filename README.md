# Homework #7

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Array -
	Array is another word for list. We make list all the time in real life. Some examples would be a grocery list, to-do list, or even a list of our lucky numbers.
	In real life we write these things down on paper and call them a list. In the world of coding we can also make list, we just reffer to them as arrays instead. 
	Arrays can include the same things list do, and can even be mixed in type. What I mean by this is we could have an Array that stores our grocery list (words) and
	our lucky numbers (numerials) together. We can add to the list as well as remove things from the list at will.
	
	* Object -
	Objects are just like objects in the real world. Take a table for example. In the real world we would describe the table by listing of its characteristics. We 
	might say it has four legs, a large surface on top, and is made of wood. in a similar way we could make an object in our code that holds all this information in
	what we call a key and value relationship. The keys to our table would be number of legs, size of top surface, and type of material it is made of. Then for key of
	those keys we could store our values; 4 legs, large, wood. By accessing this object we could gain a better idea of what our table actually looks and feels like. 
	
	* Method -
	Methods are a set of instructions that can be included in an object. In our case we have an object describing a table. We could make a method that list off all 
	the objects key and value pairings at once. This would save us the trouble of accessing each one individually. Another common example: Consider an object called person
	that has the key and value pairings of firstName:John and lastName:Doe. We could then write a method inside the object to return the full name of John Doe.  


3. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master


4. Move into the `lswebhomework7` folder in your terminal and run `npm install` 


4. Make the tests pass! (Use `npm test`)
